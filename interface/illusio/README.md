About
-----
Illusio is an open source digital musical instrument that allows the control of real-time recorded loops through collaborative and ludic performances based on relationships between sketches and sounds.

Developed in Processing and Openframeworks, it mixes multitouch technologies with the interaction metaphor of guitar pedals.

Concept and development by Jeraman, finalized in 2011.

Developed with the support of Rumos Itaú Cultural Arte Cibernética 2009.
